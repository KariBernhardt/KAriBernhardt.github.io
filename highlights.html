            I am proud to have been one of only five individuals nationwide to
            be awarded the prestigious Loretta Ford Centennial Scholarship,
            which recognizes outstanding nursing students who demonstrate
            exceptional potential in the field. This highly competitive
            scholarship is a testament to my academic and professional
            achievements as a graduate student, as well as my commitment to
            excellence in patient care. As a recipient of this scholarship, I am
            inspired to continue pursuing my passion for nursing and to make a
            positive impact in the field. I am grateful for the opportunity to
            represent my institution and to contribute to the legacy of Loretta
            Ford, a pioneer in the nursing profession.

              I am thrilled to have completed my Doctor of Nursing Practice
              Project, which was an evidence-based practice project focused on
              fertility awareness. Along with my two academic partners, we
              implemented a menstrual cycle health education program for the
              University of Mary St. Gianna School of Health Sciences. This
              project aimed to improve college students' knowledge and
              understanding of fertility & reproductive health for personal and
              professional use. Completing this project was a significant
              achievement for me, as it allowed me to apply the knowledge and
              skills I had gained throughout my academic and professional career
              to develop an innovative approach to nursing education and patient
              care. I am proud to have contributed to advancing the field of
              nursing and to have made a positive impact on the lives of
              patients and students alike.

              The attached documents comprise evaluations completed by various
              preceptors throughout my graduate education. These evaluations
              provide an assessment of my performance during my clinical
              rotations. The evaluations cover various aspects of my clinical
              skills, including my communication skills, critical thinking
              ability, clinical judgment, and patient care skills. These
              evaluations are an important component of my graduate education,
              as they allow me to receive feedback on my performance and
              identify areas for improvement. Additionally, these evaluations
              serve as evidence of my clinical competency.

              I am proud to have been selected by the Dean of Nursing at my
              Catholic University to be interviewed by Our Sunday Visitor
              regarding my experience as a student during the boom of online
              learning. This opportunity allowed me to share my insights on the
              challenges and successes of adapting to a virtual learning
              environment, while staying true to the values and mission of my
              Catholic institution. Being chosen to represent the University of
              Mary in this way was an honor and a testament to my hard work and
              dedication as a graduate nursing student. I am grateful for the
              chance to contribute to the larger conversation surrounding online
              learning and to offer my perspective on how Catholic Universities
              can maintain their unique identities in a rapidly changing
              educational landscape.
