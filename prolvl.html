            I have achieved competency in each area of focus outlined in the
            NONPF Nurse Practitioner Core Competencies, as evidenced by the
            examples provided. Critiquing scientific data and utilizing it to
            guide best practice has been an area of strength for me. I have also
            demonstrated proficiency in performing comprehensive literature
            reviews and identifying high-quality data sources. In addition, I
            have exhibited strong leadership skills in group work,
            interdisciplinary collaborations, and patient care situations.
            Utilizing technology effectively has been a central skill throughout
            my graduate education, and I will continue to embrace cutting-edge
            technology to improve my workflow and enhance patient outcomes. My
            exposure to healthcare policy has been valuable, and I intend to
            further develop my skills in broader healthcare advocacy by
            enrolling in the state nurse practitioner association to leverage my
            voice in health policy advocacy. I am also committed to building
            varied interprofessional relationships to improve the flow of
            patient care, particularly in preventative health, which is a key
            area of focus for me. Overall, I feel well-prepared with a broad and
            deep foundation of nursing knowledge and skill to provide
            comprehensive holistic care to my patients. I will incorporate these
            skills into the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of disease,
            with a continued emphasis on health prevention and primary care
            advocacy.
