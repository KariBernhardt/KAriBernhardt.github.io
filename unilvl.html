            The Benedictine Value of Community resonates deeply with me for
            several reasons. Firstly, I view the entire healthcare system as a
            vast, interconnected community working together to provide
            exceptional patient care. It has been a privilege to be a part of
            this community for several years now, as it has allowed me to
            discover my passion for helping others in ways that I would not have
            thought possible. Additionally, I am proud to have been a member of
            the community of student scholars at the University of Mary, where I
            learned the value of collaborative work towards academic and patient
            care goals. Being a part of a community has also taught me the
            importance of supporting each other through difficult times and
            celebrating each other's successes.

              During my time at the University of Mary, I have found the
              Benedictine Value of Respect for Persons to be highly influential.
              This value acknowledges the inherent worth and individuality of
              each person. As a student in the healthcare field, I have
              witnessed the positive impact of inclusive and collaborative work
              environments that prioritize empathy, understanding, and
              compassion towards both colleagues and patients. Furthermore, I
              have seen noticeable improvement in communication, teamwork, and
              productivity. I have personally experienced the benefits of
              appreciating this Benedictine value, which has led me to become
              more receptive to diverse perspectives and fostered my ability to
              innovate when it comes to problem-solving and decision-making.

              The Benedictine Value of Service has been a driving force in my
              personal and professional development, particularly in my
              healthcare career. My clinical experiences have taught me how to
              provide care for individuals from diverse backgrounds, regardless
              of their socioeconomic status or cultural beliefs. Through these
              experiences, I have come to understand the significance of
              providing high-quality care with kindness and compassion, as it
              has a significant impact on a patient's overall experience. I
              believe that as healthcare providers, we should practice servant
              leadership, which involves placing the needs of our patients above
              our own and utilizing our gifts and talents to serve others.
              Additionally, the value of time cannot be underestimated in
              healthcare.Investing time in developing strong relationships with
              our patients is critical in providing them with personalized care
              that is tailored to their specific needs. The Benedictine Value of
              Service has played a significant role in shaping my perspective as
              a healthcare provider and has inspired me to approach my work with
              compassion, kindness, and a deep commitment to serving others.
